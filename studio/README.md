# Studio preservation contracts

This directory currently contains metadata only. It does not contain an integrated editor, a vendored Freecut checkout, a renderer, a worker, model weights, hardware qualification, or licensed Dolby tools.

- `freecut-provenance.json` records the immutable upstream Freecut revision, exact archive URL and digest, MIT license, and 2,646 ordered source-file hashes.
- `freecut-feature-manifest.json` preserves 210 source-derived feature rows and a pinned contract for all 2,204 family-source references across ten categories. Every row remains explicitly not implemented in Frameleaf, not run, and unqualified for rendering.
- `dependency-attribution.json` records preliminary dependency and asset review obligations plus a pinned 51-row package name/version/license projection from the provenance-bound Freecut lockfile. It is not a completed legal or redistribution approval.

The provenance ledger was cross-checked during FL-25 against a temporary clean checkout of `walterlow/freecut@4d62e8082c5eb387a96275bcbd323d28f6e41a62`. The clean tree contained 2,646 files and matched every recorded path and SHA-256 digest. SHA-256 of the UTF-8 bytes of `JSON.stringify(files)` in recorded order is `a56d57c4bcd2c996c389bb7470216b185caa28de389def109bf4d86fd95e3adb`, covering every row whether or not a feature references it. The exact codeload URL is pinned, and its archive matched SHA-256 `b4224e5c219a6302586cbe2242e9e6d299dfd1878f1fcd0f2d77ea3db12a5d32`. This is source-identity evidence only, not execution or qualification evidence.

All contract JSON is parsed with duplicate-key rejection before these identities are evaluated. Run the metadata-only contract checks from the repository root:

```sh
node scripts/frameleaf-studio-contracts.mjs --repository .
node --test scripts/frameleaf-studio-contracts.test.mjs
```

See [the Studio, rendering and restoration preservation plan](../docs/docs/developer/frameleaf-plan/03-studio-rendering-and-restoration.md) for scope, ownership and remaining proof gates.

## Web integration boundary (FL-88)

The Svelte host for the editor is already in the production application, and it does not
depend on this directory containing anything yet:

- `web/src/lib/frameleaf/studio/host-contract.ts` is the typed `mount` / `update` /
  `dispose` contract an adapter must satisfy, plus the data the host passes (project handle,
  authorized media URLs, identity, theme tokens, capabilities, online state) and the services
  it exposes back. The engine receives no token, no API base URL and no SDK.
- `web/src/lib/frameleaf/studio/commands.ts` is the canonical command vocabulary and
  registry; `bridge.ts` validates and routes it.
- `web/src/lib/frameleaf/studio/engine-loader.ts` resolves the engine. The adapter package
  (`studio/adapters/web`, not present) calls `registerStudioEngine` once from its entry
  point. The loader refuses any module whose `engineRevision` is not the pinned commit in
  `freecut-provenance.json`, and the route renders an honest unavailable state until an
  engine registers.

Adapters live outside `vendor/freecut`; nothing in the vendored snapshot is edited, and any
unavoidable patch is recorded as a versioned patch with its licensing note.
