# Remote Machine Learning

To alleviate [performance issues on low-memory systems](/FAQ.mdx#why-is-immich-slow-on-low-memory-systems-like-the-raspberry-pi) like the Raspberry Pi, you may also host Immich's machine learning container on a more powerful system, such as your laptop or desktop computer. The server container will send requests containing the image preview to the remote machine learning container for processing. The machine learning container does not persist this data or associate it with a particular user.

:::info
Smart Search and Face Detection will use this feature, but Facial Recognition will not. This is because Facial Recognition uses the _outputs_ of these models that have already been saved to the database. As such, its processing is between the server container and the database.
:::

:::danger
Image previews are sent to the remote machine learning container. Use this option carefully when running this on a public computer or a paid processing cloud. Additionally, as an internal service, the machine learning container has no security measures whatsoever. Please be mindful of where it's deployed and who can access it.
:::

1. Ensure the remote server has Docker installed
2. Copy the following `docker-compose.yml` to the remote server

:::info
If using hardware acceleration, the [hwaccel.ml.yml](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/hwaccel.ml.yml) file also needs to be added and the `docker-compose.yml` needs to be configured as described in the [hardware acceleration documentation](/features/ml-hardware-acceleration)
:::

```yaml
name: immich_remote_ml

services:
  immich-machine-learning:
    container_name: immich_machine_learning
    # For hardware acceleration, add one of -[armnn, cuda, rocm, openvino, rknn] to the image tag.
    # Example tag: ${IMMICH_VERSION:-release}-cuda
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-machine-learning:${IMMICH_VERSION:-release}
    # extends:
    #   file: hwaccel.ml.yml
    #   service: # set to one of [armnn, cuda, rocm, openvino, openvino-wsl, rknn] for accelerated inference - use the `-wsl` version for WSL2 where applicable
    volumes:
      - model-cache:/cache
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3003:3003

volumes:
  model-cache:
```

3. Start the remote machine learning container by running `docker compose up -d`

:::info
Version mismatches between both hosts may cause bugs and instability, so remember to update this container as well when updating the local Immich instance.
:::

4. Navigate to the [Machine Learning Settings](https://my.immich.app/admin/system-settings?isOpen=machine-learning)
5. Click _Add URL_
6. Fill the new field with the URL to the remote machine learning container, e.g. `http://ip:port`

## Forcing remote processing

Adding a new URL to the settings is recommended over replacing the existing URL. This is because it will allow machine learning tasks to be processed successfully when the remote server is down by falling back to the local machine learning container. If you do not want machine learning tasks to be processed locally when the remote server is not available, you can instead replace the existing URL and only provide the remote container's URL. If doing this, you can remove the `immich-machine-learning` section of the local `docker-compose.yml` file to save resources, as this service will never be used.

Do note that this will mean that Smart Search and Face Detection jobs will fail to be processed when the remote instance is not available. This in turn means that tasks dependent on these features—Duplicate Detection and Facial Recognition—will not run for affected assets. If this occurs, you must manually click the _Missing_ button next to Smart Search and Face Detection in the [Job Status](http://my.immich.app/admin/queues) page for the jobs to be retried.

## Load balancing

While several URLs can be provided in the settings, they are tried sequentially; there is no attempt to distribute load across multiple containers. It is recommended to use a dedicated load balancer for such use-cases and specify it as the only URL. Among other things, it may enable the use of different APIs on the same server by running multiple containers with different configurations. For example, one might run an OpenVINO container in addition to a CUDA container, or run a standard release container to maximize both CPU and GPU utilization.

:::tip
The machine learning container can be shared among several Immich instances regardless of the models a particular instance uses. However, using different models will lead to higher peak memory usage.

## Using RunPod (cloud GPU)

If your hardware can't run smart-search, face detection, OCR, or image description at a reasonable pace, you can offload them to a [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/) cloud GPU. Immich offers two modes you pick per-instance in the admin panel:

| Mode                       | Active price (A5000 example) | Idle price                     | When to pick                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pod** (dedicated)        | $0.16/hr                     | $0.16/hr (billed continuously) | Big one-shot backfills, sustained heavy use, lowest active cost.      |
| **Serverless** (on-demand) | $0.68/hr                     | $0.00/hr (`workersMin=0`)      | Trickle uploads, leave-it-on usage, no manual stop discipline needed. |

Break-even is around 6 active hours per 24h — most home libraries with a handful of uploads per day sit well below that and should pick Serverless. Pod still wins for the initial library scan.

This fork ships a purpose-built image, `ghcr.io/adamtaylor152/immich-machine-learning:fork-main-cuda-runpod`, which is identical to the standard CUDA image plus a few RunPod-tuned defaults (preloads the CLIP and face-recognition models at boot, disables idle model unloading, raises the HTTP keep-alive to match RunPod's 100 s proxy timeout). It works for both modes without changes.

### One-time setup

1. Create a [RunPod API key](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings) with pod + serverless create/read/delete permission.
2. In Immich → **Administration → System Settings → Machine Learning → Cloud GPU (RunPod)**:
   - Pick a **Mode** — Pod or Serverless.
   - Paste the API key and click **Test connection**.
   - For **Pod** mode: pick a GPU type (RTX A5000 is the cheapest 24 GB option; RTX 4090 is faster). Set **Auto-stop after idle (minutes)** — the default 15 is fine for one-off backfills. Set **Max runtime (hours)** — a hard ceiling, default 24, to prevent runaway billing.
   - For **Serverless** mode: provide an ordered list of **GPU pool IDs** — `AMPERE_24`, `ADA_24`, `AMPERE_48`, etc. (RunPod's serverless API uses pool IDs, not specific types like "NVIDIA RTX A5000"; see [GPU pools](https://docs.runpod.io/references/gpu-types#gpu-pools)). Adjust `Min workers` (default `0` for true scale-to-zero), `Max workers`, and `Idle timeout` if the defaults don't fit. Behind the scenes, Immich creates the endpoint as a **Load Balancer** type (RunPod's GraphQL `type: "LB"`) so it forwards raw HTTP — the REST API doesn't expose this field, so the integration uses the GraphQL `saveEndpoint` mutation.
   - Tick the data-privacy acknowledgement.
3. Click **Launch pod** (Pod mode) or **Set up endpoint** (Serverless mode). Pod first launch takes ~2–3 minutes; subsequent resume from a stopped pod takes ~15–30 seconds. Serverless endpoint creation is ~5–10 seconds; the first request afterwards triggers a ~30–60s cold start while RunPod spins up a worker.

While the pod is **starting**, ML jobs keep running against your local container (if you have one) — Immich only routes jobs to the cloud GPU once it returns `pong`. The RunPod URL is added to the live ML config as a managed entry; you'll see it as a read-only line above the editable URL list.

### Running a backfill

After the pod reports **Running**, click **Run ML backfill** to enqueue smart-search, face detection, duplicate detection, OCR, image description, and NSFW detection for every eligible asset. The pod handles the work; the auto-stop timer kicks in once the queues drain.

You can also tick **Auto-backfill on launch** to fire the same set automatically every time the pod transitions to **Running**.

### Stopping vs terminating

- **Stop** keeps the persistent volume (and your cached model weights) — next launch is fast.
- **Terminate** destroys the pod and the volume — next launch is a full ~3-minute cold start.

### Security

In **Pod** mode the pod is exposed at `https://<pod-id>-3003.proxy.runpod.net` and is reachable from anywhere on the internet. Immich addresses this by generating a per-launch bearer token, injecting it into the container's `IMMICH_ML_AUTH_TOKEN` env var, and adding an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every request. Any request without the matching token gets a 401. Health endpoints (`/`, `/ping`) stay unauthenticated so RunPod's proxy health probes work.

In **Serverless** mode the endpoint is at `https://<endpoint-id>.api.runpod.ai/...` and RunPod's edge proxy enforces auth itself — every request must include `Authorization: Bearer <RUNPOD_API_KEY>`. Immich passes the API key as the bearer to each request automatically; you don't need a separate per-instance secret. The middleware `IMMICH_ML_AUTH_TOKEN` is NOT set in this mode (the double-bearer wouldn't be forwarded through the proxy anyway).

:::info Cold-start caveat
With `workersMin = 0` (true scale-to-zero), the first ML request after an idle period triggers a worker boot that takes ~30–90 s. Immich's default **Availability checks → timeout** (2 s) is far below that, so the periodic health probe marks the endpoint unhealthy and Immich falls back to local ML URLs. Either:

1. Set `workersMin = 1` (keeps one warm; ~$80/mo on an A5000 but no cold starts), or
2. Bump **Availability checks → timeout** to 60–120 s if you can tolerate per-job cold-start delay.
   :::

:::danger
The RunPod API key can spin up paid infrastructure. Treat it like a credit-card credential — anyone with admin access to Immich (or read access to its Postgres database) can spend money on your RunPod account.
:::

:::tip
For a self-hosted CUDA box on your LAN, the standard `Add URL` flow above is still the right answer. RunPod is for users without local GPU hardware.
